# Storm-Mind v1.0
A machine learning program aimed at generating intelligent problem solving.

The current c++ library supports evolutionary training for neural networks. Future developments are aimed at model and training diversity, with targeted fields being Reinforcement Learning, Gene Speciation, and Deep Belief Networks.

This project serves as an experimental research package for developing lightweight c++ neural networks.
