# Storm-Mind v1.0
A machine learning program aimed at generating intelligent problem solving. It serves as a testbed to develop my skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

The current c++ library supports evolutionary training for neural networks. Future training algorithms will build on the current neural net classes to achieve Reinforcement Learning, Gene Speciation, and Deep Belief Networks.
